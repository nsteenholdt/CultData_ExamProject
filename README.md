# CultData_ExamProject
This is a repository that will contain our exam project, which consists of a script that can visualise some of your Netflix activity.

The script is in RMarkdown format and should be able to run, so long as you clone the entire repository yourself. 
You can choose to use the .csv file that is provided in this repository, which consists of my (Nanna) own viewing history, and therefore you do not need to have a Netflix account to run this script. 

However, if you are interested in visualising your own data from your own Netflix account, do the following:

- Log into your Netflix account on desktop. 
- Click on your personal account (each person on the Netflix account has their own viewing history)
- Click on the icon in the top right corner 
- Click "Account"
- Scroll down and click on your accounts icon
- Next to "Viewing History" click on "View"
- Scroll down and click "Download all" 

Now you have a file called "NetFlixViewingHistory.csv"
